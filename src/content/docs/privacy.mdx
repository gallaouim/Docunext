# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: January 13, 2026**
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information across our mobile applications (the “Applications”), with specific details regarding face data processing as required by App Store guidelines.
## 1. Information We Collect
### A. Face Data & AI Processing
Our Application includes AI-powered features that allow you to "toonify" or apply artistic filters to photos. 
- **What we collect:** When you select a photo, the Application analyzes facial landmarks (face data) within the image. 
- **Purpose of collection:** This analysis is used exclusively to maintain the likeness and geometry of the face while applying artistic transformations. 
- **No Biometric Identification:** We do not use face data to personally identify or authenticate users.
- **Retention:** We do **not** store face data or images on our own servers. Face data is processed in real-time. 
- **Third-Party Sharing:** Images are shared with **Replicate, Inc.** (our AI processing partner). Replicate processes this data to generate the artistic output and retains it only for a transient period (typically less than 24 hours) for technical debugging, after which it is permanently deleted. They do not use your data to train their models.
- **No Indefinite Storage:** We do not store face data indefinitely.
### B. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions
We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions. We collect anonymous transaction identifiers to validate your purchase status. **We do not see or store your credit card information**; all payments are handled securely by Apple or Google.
### C. Device & Usage Data
We automatically collect:
- **Device Identifiers**: IDFA (Apple) or AAID (Google) for advertising and analytics.
- **Usage Data**: Crash logs, app interactions, and performance metrics.
## 2. Advertising (Appodeal)
We use **Appodeal** for ad mediation. They and their partners may collect your IP address and Advertising ID to show relevant ads. You can opt out of tracking in your device settings ("Ask App Not to Track").
## 3. Data Sharing & Security
We **do not sell your data**. Data is shared only with service providers (Replicate, Inc. for AI, RevenueCat for payments, Appodeal for ads) necessary to run the app, or as required by law. These third parties are prohibited from using your data for any other purpose.
## 4. Children’s Privacy
Our Applications are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
