# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information across our mobile applications (collectively, the “Applications”), with specific details regarding face data processing as required by App Store guidelines.
## 1. Information We Collect
### A. Face Data & AI Processing
Our Applications include AI-powered features that allow you to transform, edit, or apply artistic filters to photos.
*   **What we collect:** When you use these features, the Applications may process images containing facial landmarks (face data) to identify the subject within the photo.
*   **Purpose of collection:** This processing is strictly used to maintain the likeness, geometry, and features of the face while applying the requested artistic, stylistic, or corrective transformations.
*   **No Biometric Identification:** We do not use face data to personally identify, authenticate, or profile users.
*   **Retention:** We do not store face data or user images on our own servers. Face data is processed in real-time and remains in memory only for the duration of the active processing request.
*   **Third-Party Sharing:** To perform high-quality AI operations, images are securely transmitted to our AI processing partner:
    *   **Replicate, Inc.:**
        *   **Purpose:** To run the AI models (e.g., Flux, Stable Diffusion, and others) that generate the visual transformations.
        *   **Retention:** Replicate retains data specifically for the time required to process the request and for a short transient period (typically less than 24 hours) for technical debugging and abuse monitoring. They do not use your data to train their public models.
        *   **Privacy Policy:** [https://replicate.com/privacy](https://replicate.com/privacy)
*   **No Indefinite Storage:** We do not store face data indefinitely. Once the final image is returned to your device, the processing data is discarded.
### B. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions
We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases across our Applications.
*   We collect anonymous transaction identifiers to validate your purchase status (e.g., ensuring you have access to Premium features).
*   We do not access, see, or store your credit card or payment information; all financial transactions are handled securely and directly by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store).
### C. Device & Usage Data
We automatically collect standard non-personal data:
*   **Device Identifiers:** IDFA (Apple) or AAID (Google) for advertising, analytics, and attribution purposes.
*   **Usage Data:** Crash logs, app interactions, and performance metrics to help us improve stability and user experience.
## 2. Advertising
We use **Appodeal** for ad mediation to display advertisements in our Applications.
*   Appodeal and its partners may collect data such as your IP address and Advertising ID to serve relevant, personalized ads.
*   **Opt-Out:** You can opt out of ad tracking in your device settings (e.g., by selecting "Ask App Not to Track" on iOS or opting out of Ads Personalization on Android).
## 3. Data Sharing & Security
We do not sell your personal data. Data is shared *only* with the specific service providers listed below, solely for the purpose of operating the Applications:
*   **Replicate, Inc.** (AI Image Processing)
*   **RevenueCat** (Subscription Management)
*   **Appodeal** (Advertising & Mediation)
These third parties are contractually obligated to protect your data and are prohibited from using it for any unauthorized purposes.
## 4. Children’s Privacy
Our Applications are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.
