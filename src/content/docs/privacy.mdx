# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: January 6, 2026**
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information across our mobile applications (the “Applications”).
## 1. Information We Collect
### A. Content & AI Processing
If the Application includes AI features (like image analysis or generation), the images or text you upload are processed by secure third-party AI services (such as Replicate or OpenAI). This data is processed in real-time to provide the service and is not used to personally identify you.
### B. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions
We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions. We collect anonymous transaction identifiers to validate your purchase status. **We do not see or store your credit card information**; all payments are handled securely by Apple or Google.
### C. Device & Usage Data
We automatically collect:
- **Device Identifiers**: IDFA (Apple) or AAID (Google) for advertising and analytics.
- **Usage Data**: Crash logs, app interactions, and performance metrics.
## 2. Advertising (Appodeal)
We use **Appodeal** for ad mediation. They and their partners may collect your IP address and Advertising ID to show relevant ads. You can opt out of tracking in your device settings ("Ask App Not to Track").
## 3. Data Sharing & Security
We **do not sell your data**. Data is shared only with service providers (AI processors, RevenueCat, Appodeal) necessary to run the app, or as required by law.
## 4. Children’s Privacy
Our Applications are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
